# Monastery360 – Digital Heritage Platform for Sikkim’s Monasteries

🚀 **Preserving the sacred heritage of Sikkim’s monasteries through immersive VR, AI-powered narration, and a digital marketplace supporting local communities.**

---

## 📖 Overview

Sikkim is home to more than **200 ancient monasteries**, many dating back to the **17th and 18th centuries**, each carrying spiritual, cultural, and architectural significance.

* Explore monasteries in **360° Virtual Reality**

Our vision: **Where ancient wisdom meets modern innovation.**
